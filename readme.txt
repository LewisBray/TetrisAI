This repository is for creating a Tetris game from scratch using OpenGL
and then creating an AI that learns to play the game.

This is an excuse to practice OpenGL which I want to get better at and
to start learning about machine learning as I've been interested in it
for a while (and it gives me an excuse to do some maths again!).  The
main reason for making the game from scratch is to be able to record
the output every frame (or every other frame, etc...) and use this to
train the neural network.  If I was to use an emulator/etc... then I
would have to reverse engineer the memory addresses that hold all of
the game state I'm interested in so making my own version seemed like
the path of least resistance.
